# Exploring the Decline in Vietnamese Language Proficiency Among U.S.-Born Vietnamese Americans

## Introduction/Project Overview

As a Vietnamese born in the United States, I would consider myself somewhere between a beginner and intermediate fluency in the Vietnamese language. I have also interacted with other Vietnamese friends who are in a similar situation as me and have always wondered if there is a trend of second and third-generation Vietnamese Americans who are not fluent enough to even hold long, in-depth conversations with their relatives, family, or other friends who are fully fluent in the language.  

To delve deeper into this issue, I aim to explore the following questions:

- **Comparison to Other Languages:** How do Vietnamese Americans compare to other ethnic group Americans in regards to language fluency?
- **Level of Education:** Could there be other reasons such as lack of exposure to the language or educational resources that may be suppressing Vietnamese language development amongst young Vietnamese American children in grade school?

## Data Overview

To address these questions, I will utilize data from the 2023 U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS), focusing on:

- **Language Spoken at Home:** This dataset provides insights into the languages individuals use in their households. There are 2 separate datasets, B160001 and B160003, that address different aspects of language proficiency in different household types.
- **Demographic and Socioeconomic Profiles:** Detailed information on age, education, income, and employment status within the Vietnamese American population.

**Note:** The raw numbers in datasets are estimates but give a general idea of trends. These datasets span over a 5-year period (2019-2023) and offer comprehensive and up-to-date information that will aid in analyzing language proficiency trends among Vietnamese Americans. All ages shown are 5 years and up.

## Data Methodology

- **Data Cleaning:** Using Excel functions to remove any irrelevant columns, transpose rows for better data computation, and handle any errors in the data.
- **Data Transformation:** Using pivot tables in Excel to extract relevant data from the ACS datasets, focusing on variables related to language spoken at home, age, and education level.

### Analysis:
- **Comparing Different Language Groups:** Comparing Vietnamese group proficiency in English versus English proficiency amongst other language groups.
- **Correlation Studies:** Examining relationships between language proficiency and factors such as education and gender.

## Deliverables

1. **Documentation about the project**
2. **Comparison to Other Languages:** A single-column table (from Pivot Charts) displaying the number of people in the U.S. that fall into the categories of speaking only English, speaking English very well, and speaking English less than very well. Two separate tables for both "speaking English very well" and "speaking English less than very well" are created, including only the top 10 highest number of speakers fitting in the respective categories.
3. **Level of Education:** A bar graph (from Pivot Charts) comparing school enrollment and educational attainment achieved among the Vietnamese community in the U.S., alongside the gender breakdown within these categories.

## Results & Insights

- Comparing those who speak Vietnamese to 42 other languages analyzed in the data, Vietnamese ranks **8th** in terms of speaking English very well.
- **Spanish speakers surpass all other language groups in number**, followed by **Chinese speakers**, who have over a million more people that can speak English very well compared to Vietnamese speakers.
- The number of Vietnamese speakers who speak English very well versus those who speak English less than very well is roughly similar.
- **College Enrollment Trends:**
  - A little over **36% of the Vietnamese population** in the U.S. are enrolled in college or graduate school, and this number has been trending upwards, reaching **42.4% in 2023**.
  - When comparing school enrollment by gender, the trend toward college or graduate school has been slightly increasing from 2013 to 2023 for both males and females.
- **Higher Education Attainment:**
  - About **49% of the Vietnamese population** have attained at least some form of higher education credential (some college experience or higher).

## Recommendations

### 1. Expand Vietnamese Language Education Programs
- Schools should offer **Vietnamese language classes**, similar to heritage language programs available for Spanish, Mandarin, and other languages.
- Vietnamese language courses at the high school and college level can help increase fluency.

### 2. Community-Based Language & Cultural Initiatives
- Support **after-school Vietnamese language programs** in Vietnamese American communities.
- Encourage **Vietnamese cultural events, media, and bilingual storytelling** to engage younger generations.

### 3. Encourage Bilingual Households & Early Language Exposure
- Parents should be encouraged to **speak Vietnamese at home** to maintain fluency among children.
- Bilingual education models (such as **dual immersion programs**) should be explored in Vietnamese American communities.

Through this analysis, I hope to highlight factors contributing to the decline in Vietnamese language proficiency among U.S.-born Vietnamese Americans. There needs to be continued efforts to support newer generations of Vietnamese Americans and other ethnic groups through dedicated language schools and programs, especially in communities with a growing Vietnamese population. 

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing strategies to preserve linguistic heritage and promote bilingualism and multilingualism within the Vietnamese community.
